# Aix Weather Widget

Modifications by suncore

Source code for the [Aix Weather Widget](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.veierland.aix) Android app.

This app was written as a personal project in order to provide a compact graphical weather graph as a single row Android widget. The app met its original design goal at an early version, and most subsequent versions have been bug fixes. The source code is dated and not shiny, and there are several hacks used in order to make a graphical widget work on Android. The source code is made public domain as it may provide utility for others. Please respect the various APIs used by the app, and please modify the user agent if you are running a modified version of the app. I can only allocate a minimal amount of time to this app and will not spend further time developing it, but please email me via Google Play if you wish to become a maintainer or plan an improvement of the app.
